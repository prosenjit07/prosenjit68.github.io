- Was part of the in-house custom ERP integration team with 2 others and we were able to speed up the integration process by at least 70% (compared to external System Integrators), using a standard base solution that could easily integrate with ClearTaxâ€™s existing APIs, while being able to only focus on client-specific configuration changes; the Same team also helped to expand and streamline the integration process at KSA.
- Developed a template builder tool, to streamline the incredibly manual and open-ended process of E-Invoice custom print template creation; an older process of creating templates used to take a minimum of 2-3 days, while the same template with more flexibility could be built in 2-3 hours using the new template builder tool we built.
- Development of a SuiteApp to facilitate the integration of NetSuite ERP data with ClearTax APIs for easy filing of GST returns and thus boost the product reach by 20% across india
- Created an open source & far cheaper solution to move away from a paid solution that aimed to automate the retrieval of tax invoice information for the Air Travel Input Credit process.
